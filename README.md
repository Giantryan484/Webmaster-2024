# Webmaster-2024

This is the code behind our 2024 TSA Webmaster submission. Our current team members are: Ryan, Kari, and Elisa

See [Quick Start Guide](Quick%20Start.md) for info on how to get started and setup your coding environment

See [Guidelines](Guidelines.md) for info regarding the styling and structure for your code (I'd prefer if we have consistent formatting)

Also, note that the gh-pages branch is the deployed version of the react app and can be remade with:
```
npm run deploy
```
whenever you wish to redeploy the production website (NOTE: don't do this past the deadline or we could be disqualified)
