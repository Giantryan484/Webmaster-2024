# Webmaster-2024

This is the code behind our 2024 TSA Webmaster submission. 

We have two team members: Ryan McCormick and Kari Ajan (I'm doing the web development, she's doing the content.)

Unfortunately, we got 3rd place at the districts competition and (because this is such a competitive event) are therefore not allowed to compete at the state-level. So, this code represents an archive of what we have made thus far.

To any recruiters or coworkers who read this, know that this was made in about one week by a single beginner React programmer who had very little experience in frontend design. Additionally, every single functionality (even the zooming) was done entirely from scratch using raw CSS and React, so please disregard the comic-sans as I was too busy making the rest of the website work.


(for Kari:)
See [Quick Start Guide](Quick%20Start.md) for info on how to get started and setup your coding environment

See [Guidelines](Guidelines.md) for info regarding the styling and structure for your code (I'd prefer if we have consistent formatting)

Also, note that the gh-pages branch is the deployed version of the react app and can be remade with:
```
npm run deploy
```
whenever you wish to redeploy the production website (NOTE: don't do this past the deadline or we could be disqualified)
